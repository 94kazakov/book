# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:


#How many people responded before the first class?
{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}



#How many people are applied math major? 	
{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}



#Who is not a computer science major? 

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


#How may people said "food" in their favorite foods? 

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
